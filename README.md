# Intellirecipe

Intellirecipe is a recipe finding website. It allows users to search for different ingredients (chicken, beef, etc.) and provides the user with a variety of recipes, instructions on how to prepare the meals, as well as nutritional values of those meals. Along with finding food recipes, the user can also search for a variety of cocktail recipes as well.

# User Story

As a developer, who always wants to have fast food instead of cooking, I want to find a variety of recipes to try for myself. I also want to make myself different drinks to go along with my meals.
